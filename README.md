This Matlab code shows an example of an image edge enhancement method using convolution and the discrete Fourier transform. 
The demo video is available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBI17E086nQ. 
Note that bio/medical edge enhancement was one of topics of the Kuopio Biomedical Image Analysis Center (KUBIAC) lecture series, available here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk_G2ywxO4EGly7_XAt7nDA
