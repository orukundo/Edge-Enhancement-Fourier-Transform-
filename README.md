This Matlab code shows an example of an image edge enhancement method using convolution and the discrete Fourier transform. 
The demo video is available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBI17E086nQ. 
Note that Edge Enhancement was one of the topics of the Kuopio Biomedical Image Analysis Center lecture series.
